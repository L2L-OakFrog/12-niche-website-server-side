## Objectives

1. `Single product` Website / `Niche website`;

2. Home page with a `(header / simple navbar), banner, products, reviews, and footer`;

3. Home page products will have a `maximum of 6 items/products` with relevant details;

4. Products will have `buy now button` which will take the user to the `purchase page`;

5. Add `one extra section` in the `home page` in addition to the 5 sections mentioned above;

6. Another page on the top navigation bar named `explore` where users will see all the products. At least 10 products with `(name, description, image, price and button)`;

7. The `purchase` page is a private/protected route. Page should `display detailed information` of the `item`. Also `a form` should display the `user's name` and `email address` & users will `provide address, phone number and necessary information` to complete the purchase;

8. The `private route` redirects to the `login page`. After login, the user will be `redirected to the page` where he/she wanted to go to. Also `reloading the page` of a private route, the user is not `redirected to the login page`;

9. Implement `email/ password (login/Register) based login` system. `After` login/register `user name, and the logout button` should appear on the header. Displaying `username on the header` is optional & so as `google, facebook, or github provider`;

10. After login show in header `Dashboard` and inside a normal user will see options like `(pay, My Orders, Review, Logout)`. The `pay` page will say: Payment system coming soon;

11. `My orders` page, the logged in user will see only his/her orders with `cancel/delete any order`. `Ask a confirmation message` before deleting or canceling an item;

12. On the `Review` page, users should be able to add a review and that review will appear on the home age;

13. Please `add one admin` with the email address: `admin@admin.com` with password: `123456`;

14. An admin will not see the options like a normal user. Instead will see `(Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin, Manage Products)`;

15. An Admin `can make` another user `(an admin, add a product on the add a product page)`. After adding the product, this product will appear on the `explore` page;

16. `Use a database` to store information. It could be `mongodb atlas` or any other `noSQL database`.

## Bonus:

1. Adding review page should have a field to `add ratings`;

2. Meaningful `README.md` file both on client side and server side with `(website name, a little description, link to your live site. And at least five bullet points mentioning different features and functionality)`;

3. `Responsive website` for mobile & tablet;

4. Make the website `meaningful and consistent` in look and feel;

5. `Clean and organized` Code;

6. Use `.env file` on the `server`, `.env.local file` on the `client` to hide db user and password, etc. Also use `.gitignore file`;

7. On the `Manage All Orders` page the admin will see the orders placed by every user. At the time of `placing an order`, every order will have a default `status: pending`. An admin will be able to `update the status` of the pending to `shipped status`. Also, it would be nice if you can `do one additional task` here: The admin will be able to `delete anyone's order` here. Make sure to `add a confirmation` before deleting. Please note: `delete is optional` but recommended on this page;

8. On the `Manage Products` page, an admin `can delete` any of the `products`. Please make sure there is `a confirmation`. After delete that product will not appear on the `explore` page.

### Optional:

1. payment gateway `(paypal or stripe or anything else)`;
2. On the `add a product` page, try to implement direct image upload from your computer. This image can be hosted on third part image hosting like imgbb or directly to mongodb
3. Add a shopping cart and Order review page
4. pagination. if you implement pagination, you can have duplicate products
5. Implement `jwt` token.
6. Manage orders page, add more options like: pending, rejected, shipped. And consider using a select (drop down options). Also, once the status of an item is updated that status is reflected on the 'my orders' page once the user of the order is logged in.
7. Try to use a better looking confirmation dialogue other than the browser's default confirm.
8. Add some animation while applicable.
9. Please Use icons whenever applicable and use fonts (google fonts)
10. Make the footer little more realistic
11. Optimize your images
12. Add something extra of your own. This will help you in the future.
13. Most of the booking will have a date, you can use browsers default input type date or any external packages
14. We encourage you to use axios.
15. Also, if you want you can use mongoose.
16. If possible, replace the default react favicon and give an icon for your website.

### Additional information:

1. You can use local image or host image anywhere if you want or both.
3. You are free to use any css library you want. But, we recommend using tailwind css. 
4. If needed you can mix CSS framework with a component library
5. You may use `react hook form`, basic html form or any library for authentication
6. Local storage is optional
8. Try to host your site on Firebase (Netlify host will need extra configuration)
9. Try to host server on heroku
